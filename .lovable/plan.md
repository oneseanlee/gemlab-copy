## Update All 5 Shopify Product Descriptions

This is a Shopify data update — no code changes are needed. I will update the description (body HTML) for each of the 5 products directly in Shopify using the product IDs retrieved.

### Products to Update

| Product | Shopify ID |
|---|---|
| TPrime365™ | 8988427911308 |
| GLP-1 Optimization Protocol | 8977141104780 |
| Ultimate Cellular Optimization System (UCOS) | 8988427976844 |
| Complete GLP-1 Cellular Bundle | 8988428009612 |
| Non-Hormonal Testosterone Bundle | 8988428075148 |

### What Will Change

Each product's description field in Shopify will be replaced with the full formatted copy you provided, including:
- Headline and subheadline
- Benefit bullet points
- Ingredients/formula breakdown
- Usage instructions
- Results/timeline
- Pricing callout
- Legal disclaimers

### Important Notes

- These changes go **live in your Shopify store immediately** — they will affect the product descriptions visible on any active Shopify storefront or checkout
- The descriptions will be written as plain text (Shopify renders line breaks natively). If you later want bold, bullet formatting, or headers in the Shopify admin, I can re-apply them as HTML
- The prices shown in the descriptions ($149/mo, $39.95, $175, etc.) are informational text only — the actual Shopify variant prices (currently $1 for TPrime and GLP-1) remain unchanged

### Execution Order

1. Update TPrime365™
2. Update GLP-1 Optimization Protocol
3. Update Ultimate Cellular Optimization System (UCOS)
4. Update Complete GLP-1 Cellular Bundle
5. Update Non-Hormonal Testosterone Bundle

All 5 updates will be made in sequence. This is purely a Shopify data operation — no code files are modified.
