## 5. Checkout Flow

### Overview
The checkout follows a **custom on-site intermediate step** strategy (Maximus-style), capturing only contact info before handing off to Shopify's native checkout for shipping and payment.

### Flow Diagram

```
User clicks "Start My Protocol" (or any product CTA)
  → addItem() called on Zustand store
  → Shopify Storefront API cartCreate/cartLinesAdd mutation
  → Cart drawer opens automatically (isCartOpen = true)
  → User clicks "Proceed to Checkout"
  → Navigates to /checkout (on-site page)
  → User enters email + optional phone
  → updateCartBuyerIdentity() called (email/phone only)
  → window.open(checkoutUrl, '_blank') → Shopify native checkout
  → Shopify handles shipping address, payment, order confirmation
  → useCartSync hook detects completed order on tab return → clears cart
```

### Key Implementation Files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `src/lib/shopify.ts` | Storefront API client, GraphQL mutations, cart CRUD functions, buyer identity update |
| `src/stores/cartStore.ts` | Zustand persistent store — items, cartId, checkoutUrl, all cart operations |
| `src/hooks/useCartSync.ts` | Syncs cart on page load and `visibilitychange` events |
| `src/components/CartDrawer.tsx` | Side drawer showing cart items, quantities, total, checkout button |
| `src/pages/CheckoutPage.tsx` | Intermediate page: email/phone form + order summary |

- Subsequent items added via `cartLinesAdd`
- Cart auto-clears on "cart not found" errors (expired carts)
- `syncCart()` runs on page load and tab visibility change — clears cart if Shopify reports `totalQuantity === 0`

### Checkout Page Details
- **Layout**: Split-panel — left form, right order summary
- **Form fields**: Email (required), Phone (optional)
- **Validation**: Zod schema via react-hook-form
- **Order summary**: Editable quantities (Minus/Plus buttons), line totals, subtotal
- **Submit action**: Updates buyer identity on cart → redirects to Shopify checkout URL in new tab
- **Resilience**: If buyer identity update fails, still redirects to checkout (best-effort pre-fill)
- **Checkout URL**: Always includes `?channel=online_store` parameter (prevents password-protected checkout)
- **Header**: Brand logo, centered "Checkout" title, back button
- **Security badge**: SSL encrypted notice at bottom
- **Input styling**: Teal focus borders (#1cb9db) with light glow effect

### Fulfillment
- Integrated with **ShipStation**
- Products must be marked as "Physical" with weight in Shopify admin for ShipStation sync
- Processing real orders requires an active Shopify paid plan

- **Sticky Navigation** — Logo + nav links + CTA + CartDrawer, adjusts offset for banner
- **Hero Section** — Product image + headline + price + CTA + trust badges
- **Trust Strip** — 4 badge cards (physician-supervised, cGMP, made in USA, guarantee)
- **Problem/Solution Grid** — 3 cards showing competitor failures → solution comparison
- **Ingredient Cards** — Detailed breakdown with icons and clinical data
- **Comparison Table** — Feature matrix with highlighted "our product" column
- **Value Stack Card** — Line items showing total value vs your price
- **Steps Grid** — Numbered 01/02/03 process cards
- **FAQ Accordion** — Left heading + right expandable Q&A (custom, not shadcn Accordion)
- **Final CTA Section** — Dark background, large price, trust points, centered CTA
- **Alternating Sections** — `.b365-section` and `.b365-section-alt` for visual rhythm

## 8. Conversion Architecture

### CTA Strategy

#### TPrime365 Page (Optimized — 10+ CTAs)
| Position | CTA Text | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| Navigation bar | "Start My Protocol" | Always visible on scroll |
| Hero section | "Start My Protocol" | Primary conversion point |
| After Problem section | "Start My Protocol" | Visitor learned competitors fail |
| After Solution section | "Start My Protocol" | Visitor saw the formula |
| After Ingredient Breakdown | "Start My Protocol" | Deep science readers are high-intent |
| After UGC Videos | "Start My Protocol" | Social proof momentum |
| After Comparison Table | "Start My Protocol" | Just saw TPrime365 wins every row |
| Final CTA Section | "Start My Protocol" | Primary conversion block |
| After FAQ | "Start My Protocol" | Catch-all for full-page readers |
| Sticky Mobile Bar (< 768px) | "Start My Protocol" | Always visible on mobile |

All CTAs use the `AnimatedCTA` component with `ArrowRight` icon and call `handleOrderNow` (which adds TPrime365 to cart and opens the cart drawer).

#### Other Product Pages
- GLP-1 Protocol: CTAs at hero + final section
- UCOS: CTAs at hero + final section
- GLP-1 Bundle: CTAs at hero + final section
- NHTO: CTAs at hero + final section
- HomePage: Product cards with individual "Add to Cart" CTAs

### Urgency Elements
- **Dynamic Monthly Pricing Lock** (TPrime365): `"{currentMonth} pricing locked at $149/mo — Next price review: {nextMonth} 1"` — Uses `new Date()` for always-current months
- Small `Clock` icon, muted text — no aggressive countdown timers
- Fits the medical-grade aesthetic

### Trust Micro-Badges Pattern
Placed directly below hero CTA buttons to reduce purchase anxiety at the first decision point:
- ✓ Physician-Reviewed
- ✓ FDA-Registered Pharmacy
- ✓ Money-Back Guarantee
- 🚚 Free Shipping

### Sticky Mobile CTA Bar
- Fixed bottom bar on viewports below 768px
- Shows price ($149/mo) + "Start My Protocol" button
- Semi-transparent dark background with blur effect
- Hidden on desktop where the nav CTA serves this purpose
- CSS class: `.tprime-sticky-mobile-cta`

### Social Proof Placement Strategy
1. **Immediately after hero** — Testimonial carousel with photos, names, product used, and result-focused quotes
2. **Mid-page UGC section** — Video testimonials (3 videos)
3. **Trust badges** — Repeated at hero and in dedicated TrustBadges component
4. **Clinical results** — Specific numbers (e.g., "658 to 749 in two months")
5. **"Verified buyer" badges** on all testimonial cards

### Section Ordering Philosophy
The TPrime365 page follows **objection handling before conversion**:
1. Hero (primary pitch + first CTA)
2. Social proof (testimonials with results)
3. Process (how it works — reduce friction)
4. Problem (why alternatives fail — create urgency)
5. Solution (our formula — provide the answer)
6. Ingredients (deep science — build credibility)
7. Benefits (what you get)
8. More social proof (UGC videos)
9. **Comparison table** (objection handler — why we're better)
10. **Value breakdown** (objection handler — justify price)
11. **Final CTA** (convert after objections are handled)
12. Dosing/Safety (post-decision reassurance)
13. FAQ (catch remaining objections)
14. Final catch-all CTA
