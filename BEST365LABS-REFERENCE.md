## 7. Key Messaging & Copy

### Hero Tagline (Main Storefront)
> "Your Hormones, *Optimized.*"
> Precision-grade testosterone and metabolic support delivered to your door. No needles. No hormonal shutdown. Just science-backed results.

### MODS Max Technology Description
> Our patent-pending sublingual delivery system uses microdose reactive oxygen species (ROS) to briefly open mucosal barriers — delivering ingredients directly into your bloodstream with up to 10x enhanced absorption.

### Guarantee Language
> Improved testosterone *or you don't pay.*
> If your physician determines you are not a candidate, the $140 consultation fee is fully refunded. You keep any supplement products included in your bundle regardless of approval status.

### TPrime365 vs Traditional TRT Positioning
> TPrime365 stimulates your NATURAL testosterone production. TRT shuts down your natural production, causes testicular atrophy, and eliminates fertility. TPrime365 preserves all of that while optimizing your levels.

### GLP-1 Crisis Messaging
> You're losing weight... but at what cost? 40% of weight lost is MUSCLE. Your mitochondria determine whether you burn fat for fuel or cannibalize your own muscle tissue.

1. **What is MODS Max™ technology?** — Patent-pending sublingual delivery with microdose ROS for 10x enhanced absorption.
